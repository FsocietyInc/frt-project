# Project Title

- Project submission for FutureReadyTalent 2021 - Portfolio with integrated Chat Bot

## Problem Statement/Opportunity

- In this project, I will face difficulty creating my assistant bot service. This bot will help the visitor be automatically guided easily by answering the queries without any problem. It will take more effort and time to complete the project from scratch. However, we can use cloud computing means like Azure services. They have inbuilt products as SAAS to facilitate such business requirements. So we can quickly complete our project and get it up and running.
- There are many opportunities to explore, and I will learn about bot services, hosting services, azure environment, integration and deployment

## Project Description
